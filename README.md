# spotify-charts
<b> Introduction: </b>
<br>
I found a dataset on Kaggle that documented the global top 200 songs from Spotify every week and downloaded the .csv file of the data. I organized the data into separate tables, renaming information, and made it easier for me to understand.

I put information about artists in one table, such as their number of followers, and created the other table based on song details, such as length, minutes streamed, and explicit content.
I created columns in both table that kept track of the serial num (a.artist_num and (s.track_number) making one of them a primary key, allowing me to create a relationship between both tables.
